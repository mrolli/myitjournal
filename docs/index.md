On these pages you will find instructions, excercises, cheatsheets, refrences, and tutorials.
Originally the material was meant to teach our apprectices in house a starting point on their
quest to obtain new skills and learn new stuff.

Courses are more work instrustions for learners of new stuff to guide them to a goal. These
link over to the guides - call them memorandums on my journey on a lot of webpages where I
gather snips and lines that are worth to be kept and remembered - that are organized by topic.

Meanwhile this technical documentaiton might morph towards my personal omnium-gatherum while
still trying to be useful for our young learners. Therefore it is and will always be in a flux.
