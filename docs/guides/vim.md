## Installing Vim

=== "macOS"
    On macOS Vim is also already installed, but it's quite an onld version and
    has no python support built in. Therefore it's suggested to install a recent
    version using Homebrew: `brew install vim`

=== "Linux"

    Every Linux distribution brings a Vim package that is installable by using the distribution's package manager.
